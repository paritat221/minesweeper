# minesweeper
Minesweeper game for casio fx cg-50 calculator

# how to play
Plug your fx cg-50 into your pc and drag and drop Minesweeper.g3a

The game is technically playable right now but it still lacks a game over screen
In future updates ill hopefully add a settings option where you can change the number of mines and the width/height of the board
